# ai-music-generator

## Introduction

In this project, we set ourselves the goal of exploring as many possibilities as possible for generating music and interpreting our models as best we could. Several approaches are proposed, ranging from predicting the most likely note after a given sequence of notes to generating a piece of music with several instruments. The two main difficulties were the following: 
* The high dimensionality of the problem which led us to use very large datasets
* The generation of a real new melody and not just a sequence of redundant notes
